You typically use the --nomodel option, as the shifting model of MACS does not
really make sense for open chromation data. As you have probably paired-end
data, also use the -f BAMPE option. It forces MACS to pileup the real fragment
length instead of an estimate, which maked sense imho, due to the quiet
different fragment sizes that the library prep creates, also if you have
paired-end why not make full use of it"


- input becomes
  BARCODE\tPATH
  need to rejig some processes.



- potentially streaming etc format is a little bit faster.

- explicit outputs in matrixmarket creation

- document suffix dependencies (w5k.txt and mp.txt)

- -c argument to cellatac script; check/select only the files that are there, i.e.
  cope with drop-outs. currently expects all cells/barcodes to succeed. need to comapre with cov.inputs
  do we just generate empt rows/columns in that case, or will something actually crash? Engineer test.
  check more generally in the pipeline that it is permissive this way.

- write samdemux.nf

- layer docker file?
    need mcl and datamash on top of R image.

# collect coverage files in meta file list with locations rather than linking.

# write matrix in old R script.  compare.

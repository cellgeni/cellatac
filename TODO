- perhaps get rid of the precious bucket structure.

- check
  clusters_makebam_P4
  we make bed file for macs2 where all features are on the positive strand.
  Any issue with this?
  Test whether macs2 picks up depth. Maybe ask even.

- devel
  when combining multiple samples, they need to use the same regions.
  Currently regions are derived from samtools view -H on the possorted bam file.

- devel
  produce mmtx format in mcxdump internally

- potentially streaming etc format is a wee bit faster. Very low priority.

- explicit outputs in matrixmarket creation (generally hardcoded names).

- -c argument to cellatac script; check/select only the files that are there,
  i.e.  cope with drop-outs. currently expects all cells/barcodes to succeed.
  need to comapre with cov.inputs. do we just generate empt rows/columns in that
  case, or will something actually crash? Engineer test.  check more generally in
  the pipeline that it is permissive this way.

- layer docker file?
    need mcl and datamash on top of R image.
